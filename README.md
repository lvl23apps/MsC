First off I am a huge fan of this project - https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp
	I really recommend going over to that project first and checking out what they have 
	put together and starting your journey there.

This index is an example of a way that you can pull in the example Webamp package
into your own site specifically ones like Squarespace and Wix that do not give you 
root access.

Using the my index ( https://github.com/lvl23apps/MsC/blob/main/MsC-Webamp_index.html)
all you have to do is drop this into a code block on your site.

If you want to customize it you will need to edit all of the content calls in the code
and use (https://www.jsdelivr.com/github) to pull the mp3's over from github into the 
CDN and then over to be able to call them in the index of the webamp script.
